PSD - THE PORTABLE SCHEME DEBUGGER 
VERSION 1.1, October 1993

This is psd, the portable Scheme debugger. It does source code
debugging for any R4RS compliant Scheme interpreter when run in a
GNU Emacs buffer (either version 18 or 19). With psd you can
 * set and clear breakpoints
 * single step evaluation
 * examine and change the variables of the debugged program
 * follow execution in an editor window
 * run a program until a run time error occurs, and examine the state
   of the program

TO INSTALL: read INSTALL
TO RUN: see the manual in doc/

Psd is known to work with Aubrey Jaffer's scm, but porting to other
Schemes should be easy.  In fact, for a R4RS Scheme you should not
have "port" it at all. It works also with Elk v. 1.5 and the sci
interpreter in the Scheme->C system.
