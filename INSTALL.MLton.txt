Compilation of RML frontent implemented in SML with the MLton compiler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

By default RML use SML/NJ for compilation but is possible 
from 2006-03-15 to compile also using MLton compiler which
generates a really faster compiler.

Just follow all the steps in INSTALL and then:

To compile the SML part of the RML:
-----------------------------------
cd compiler
compiler> mlton -verbose 3 -target self rml.mlb
then just copy the rml executable in the 
rml/arch-os-compiler/bin/
and edit the 
rml/arch-os-compiler/bin/rmlc 
to call the executable instead of the rml script.

If you run into problems send me an email.

Enjoy,
