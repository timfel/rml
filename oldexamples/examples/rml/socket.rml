 ** This is the socket connection module of the compiler
 ** Used in interactive mode if modeq is started with +d=interactive
 ** Implemented in ./runtime/soecketimpl.c
 ** Not implemented in Win32 builds use +d=interactiveCorba instead.
 **)

module Socket:
(** relation: waitforconnect
 ** Takes a port number and returns a socket id, for a connected client 
 ** External implementation in C
 **)						      
          relation waitforconnect: int => int

(** relation: handlerequest
 ** Takes a socket id and returns a string id from it.
 ** External implementation in C
**)		  
	  relation handlerequest: int => string
	  
(** relation: sendreply: 
 ** Takes a socket id and a string, and sends the string as a reply to a given request on that socket id.
 ** External implementation in C
 **)
	  relation sendreply: (int, string) => ()
(** relation: close
 ** Takes a socket id and closes the socket
**)
	  relation close: int => ()

(** relation: cleanup
